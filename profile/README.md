# HomeMadeGames LLC Promise

At HomeMadeGames LLC, we are committed to providing our gaming community with an exceptional and fair experience while prioritizing your privacy and data security. As part of our dedication to transparency and user-friendly practices, we promise:

## Data Privacy
- We will never sell your information.
- If you purchase our game, we will only keep your information as required by law.
- We do not want your personal data.

## Fair Gameplay
- **Non-Kernel-Level Anti-Cheat:** Any anti-cheat measures implemented in our games will not operate at the kernel level, ensuring the security and privacy of your system.
- **Fair Microtransactions:** Items purchasable with real-world currency will strictly be for visual preferences. No gameplay-changing perks will ever be available for purchase.

## Opt-In Data Collection
- **Single-Player:** The only data we seek to collect for single-player mode are related to improving your gaming experience, such as crash reports and hardware specifications. This will only occur on an opt-in basis. When data is to be sent to us, users will be informed exactly what information will be transmitted, allowing them to choose whether to send that data.
- **Multiplayer:** To ensure fair play and prevent cheating in multiplayer mode, crash reports and bug data must be enabled. Users cannot opt out of sending crash reports in multiplayer mode.

## Game Accessibility
- **No 3rd Party Launchers:** Our games will never require the use of any third-party launcher. Enjoy our games directly without any additional software.
- **Non-Intrusive Ads:** If advertisements are ever incorporated into our games, they will never interfere with gameplay. Your gaming experience will always remain uninterrupted. Currently, there are no plans to include ads in our games. If we ever decide to include ads, they will only be present in games that are free to play.

## Community Support
- **Open Sourcing Multiplayer Code:** In the event that we decide to cease running multiplayer game servers, we pledge to open source the multiplayer code, allowing the community to continue running the game servers independently.

This is our promise to you, our valued community members. Your satisfaction, privacy, and enjoyment are our top priorities at HomeMadeGames LLC.
